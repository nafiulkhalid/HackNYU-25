Excited to share another AMAZING weekend when I went to NY for the first time! Despite the dilemma between DevFest & HackNYU this year, I attended HackNYU-2025. Due to Winter Storm Garnett in NY, I got a 6-hour layover to my favorite city, Boston. During this 36-hour hackathon of Major League Hacking (MLH), we competed for the 'Fintech/Quant' track and built Genieâ€”your one-stop, all-in-one saving partner, preventing you from overspending.

[Wait, wait, isn't it like Honey or Pie? -- No, it's more!]

___Why Genie___
"Save More, Shop More"
> Everyone has a wishlist! Would you buy them if you had money?
In Genie, we help you save, crack the best deals, & prevent you from overspending! We believe, if you save more, you can shop more!
On the other side, more transactions are win-win too for banks too!


___What's Genie___
> Easy-to-use, lightweight browser extension
> Prevents you from overspending: Provides personalized spending insights & track your purchases
> Records & analyzes your spending habits & offers tailored suggestions right on your screen using Gemini
> Smarter shopping decisions, stretching your budget with same shopping experience & expectation!
> Record & keep track of your coupons, discounts, vouchers, cashbacks, etc so you can totally forget about them & we will remind you if applicable
> Send message notifications if any voucher, coupon, or discount is due soon, so you dont miss them
> Pin websites so if there's a sale or pricedrop, users who pinned the site receive a message notification

Aren't they a lot of features? Yes. Even I was surprised too with the potentiality and seriousness of the event! Although many of them were in our optional planning in this project design document, with my incredible teammates Erika Neri, Nguyen Tran, and Mike Odnis we brought them all to reality!
